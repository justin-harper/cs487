I chose to implement my solution using C# with Visual Studio 2015 using Windows 10
This solution complies and runs without error on my machine.
You should be able to Download -> Unzip -> and Open my solution file to run my code 
Let me know if you have trouble

I have included a PDF of my answers to the prompts in this folder which also contains my StarUML diagram
